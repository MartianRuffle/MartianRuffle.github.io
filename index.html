 <h4>What's a code kitchen? Is there a box of bagels in it? What is with this name? Well, it was a random generation and I thought it was funny, so why not? </h4>
     <p>Sooooo, okay, you got the name. Now you're probably asking yourself: Does this webpage need to exist? I mean, really? Yes, indeed it does! I'm learning to code and I need a place to learn that is not a controled code gym
      or other simulated environment. Maybe I'll take it down, I will definitely update the content, but for now, enjoy the ridiculousness.
      My goals for this page include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn to code</li>
          <li>Make it funny </li>
          <li>Eventually apply these skills somewhere in my life</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I
        <p>I make a lot of mistakes while learning and often get frustrated.  Maybe I need to reassess my self-compassion: <a href="https://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/" target="_blank">Self Compassion Quiz.</a></p>
