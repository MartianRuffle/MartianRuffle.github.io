 <h4>What is with this name? Well, let me break it down for you. Martian because feelings are not my home planet -- you could say I'm a Trainee -- and Ruffle because it's funny and I like basil. </h4>
     <p>Sooooo, okay, you got the name. Now you're probably asking yourself: Does this need to be a webpage? I mean, really? Yes, indeed it does! I'm learning to code on Codecademy, I need material to make this page, and a constant that I can write about is my attempts how to recognize and process feelings! My goals for this page include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn to code</li>
          <li>Control the feelings that plague my mind, body, and actions</li>
          <li>Help the world</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is the podcast I'm currently listening to: <a href="https://peterattiamd.com/estherperel/" target="_blank">Peter Attia</a></p>
        <p>Someone suggested that I take this: <a href="https://self-compassion.org/test-how-self-compassionate-you-are/" target="_blank">Self Compassion Quiz</a> Let's just say that I'm not average and definitely not an understater on this matter.</p>
